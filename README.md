# FORMAT-C-DRVE

Format the C: drive within a second!

## HOW DOES WORK:
- While finding a code which formats the C: drive in Google, I got an idea: why I don't write an MBR, which resets the hard disk, in assembly!
- First thing, I wrote the MBR in assembly(see code.asm)
- Next, I assembled it(lol) and I converted it into the C extension (use a converter, like HxD, etc...)
- Then, I wrote a C++ code (see main.cpp)
- Finally, I decided to share it, int GitHub!

## VERY IMPORTANT NOTICE: use it at your own risk! For educational purposes only!
## And, this isn't a simple MBR overwritter, it's VERY VERY DANGEROUS! :O IT HELPS LOSING YOUR DATA!!!

Finally, when the victime finds that his data are gone: "xP" (GRAND DEAD) xD
